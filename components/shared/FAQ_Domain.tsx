      <FAQ_Component title="What Is a Domain Name?">
        <p>
          A domain name, or simply domain, is similar to a home address in real
          life. It is how people find your site online - they enter the domain
          in a web browser or search engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hostinger.com is a domain, just like Google.com and Facebook.com.
          Ideally, a domain should be registered under the same name as the
          brand it is representing.
        </p>
      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="Why Do I Need to Buy a Domain Name?">
        <p>
          It is important to buy domain names to help potential visitors find
          your site. Without assigned website names, we would only be able to
          access them by entering their IP address, which is more difficult to
          remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          While performing a domain search to look for a good name, you can
          include keywords or brand names.
        </p>
      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="How to Search for a Perfect Website Name?">
        <p>The best practices for buying domain names include the following:</p>
        <li>
          <strong>Lenght. </strong>Keep it short. Two to three words is ideal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple. </strong>Dont use any lenghty or hard-to-spell words.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keywords. </strong>Include a keyword from your niche. For
          example, if you sell coffee beans in Seattle, try
          Seattlecoffeebeans.com.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid numbers. </strong>Numbers are hard to remember and make
          everything more complex.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brand name. </strong>Buy a domain name that includes your
          brand for maximum recognition.
        </li>
      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="Once I register a Domain, Can I Change It Later?">
        <p>
          No, once you register a domain, you cannot change it. However, you can
          buy another domain name and move your website there.
        </p>
      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="How Long Does a Domain Name Registration Lats?">
        <p>
          The minimum registration period for domain names is one year. With
          Hostinger, you can also register .com, .net, .org, and other domains
          for up to three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to make sure that your domains are always registered to
          you and keep your website available online all the time, we recommend
          setting up automatic renewal.
        </p>
      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="Do I Need to Add www When Using Domain Checker?">
        <p>No. The www in front of a URL is not a part of your domain.</p>
        <p>
          If you add www in front of your desired domain in the domain name
          checker is field, the final website address will look something like
          this: www.wwwexample.com. For that reason, you should not add www.

      <FAQ_Component title="What Are TLDs, ccTLDs, and gTLDs?">
        <p>
          TLD stands for top-level domain. It is the final component of a
          domain, like .com.
        </p>
        <p>
          ccTLD stands for country-code top-level domain. It is a subcategory of
          TLDs used to identify a particular country - for example, .co.uk, .de,
          .mx, and .fr are all ccTLDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          gTLD stands for generic top-level domain. gTLDs are the most common
          type of domain name, in part because this category includes .com
          domains, which have more registrations than all ccTLDs combined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, the main gTLDs were .com, .org, .net, .edu, .gov, and
          .mil, but the number of available domain extensions has been expanded
          with the addition of TLDs like .online, .xyz, and .name.

      <FAQ_Component title="What if the Website Name Is Unvailable?">
        <p>
          If the website name has already been registered, you can try another
          extension. Often, the most popular extensions are already taken, but
          country-specific extensions such as .co.uk, or less common ones like
          .xyz or .online might still be available. Our domain search tool will
          also suggest other great available options.

      <FAQ_Component title="What Is Privacy Protection?">
        <p>
          Privacy protection is sometimes called WHOIS protection because it
          hides certain information about a domain name is owner that would
          otherwise be discoverable through a WHOIS lookup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy protection lets the domain registrar replace your name,
          address, phone number, email address, and business name with a set of
          generic, non-identifiable information.

      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="What Is the Difference Between .com, .net, .org, and .info?">
        <p>
          Each gTLD carries a slightly different meaning, so it is usually best
          to pick one that is most relevant to your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Domain names ending in .com are commonly used for commercial purposes,
          although they are becoming the default option as they imply a certain
          amount of trust. .net domains were originally used by networking
          companies, such as internet service providers, but are now
          multipurpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Domains ending in .org are still largely used as originally intended -
          as the gTLD for charities, communities, and local organizations.
          Meanwhile, .info is aimed at information-based websites such as wikis
          and tutorial sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all of these gTLDs, there is a certain amount of wiggle room.
          There is no rule saying you have to use one type of TLD or another.
          Think of the above information as guidelines when purchasing a domain
          name that is most relevant to your website.

      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="What Is the Difference Between a Domain Name and Web Hosting?">
        <p>
          Think of your domain name as your home address and web hosting as the
          physical structure, like the house. A domain can help people find your
          site; hosting is the online space to store your website data. To
          publish a website, you will need to buy domain and hosting services so
          that visitors have an easier time finding your site on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is technically possible to have one without the other, they
          work best together. This is why many hosting companies often domain
          names and many domain registrar often hosting services.
