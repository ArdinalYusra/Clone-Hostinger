      <FAQ_Component title="What Is Web Hosting and Why Do I Need It?">
        <p>
          Web hosting is a service that makes your website available on the
          internet. The hosting service provides a secure online space to store
          your websites files: the code, images, text, and other content. Simply
          put, you need a hosting plan to make your site up and accessible for
          anyone.

          The most popular website hosting services for both personal and
          business use include:

        <div className="space-y-5">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">- Shared hosting.</span> Multiple
            websites are hosted on a single server, and each user gets a certain
            amount of storage space and resources. It is the most affordable
            hosting solution, making it an excellent choice for beginners and
            bloggers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">- WordPress hosting.</span> It works
            similarly to shared hosting. The difference is, Managed WordPress
            hosting companies offer plenty of tools and features to optimize
            your WordPress website for speed and performance, and facilitate
            site maintenance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">- VPS hosting.</span> This type of
            web hosting service divides a physical server into several virtual
            machines, powering each user with dedicated resources and full root
            access. Virtual private server (VPS) hosting plans are more geared
            toward tech-savvy users who need more power and control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">- Cloud hosting.</span> In this
            setup, websites run on multiple virtual servers, reducing possible
            downtime and hardware failure. Cloud hosting plans are ideal if you
            need stable website uptime and performance, for example, if you are
            a freelancer web developer with many clients.

      <FAQ_Component title="Do You Offer a Web Hosting and Domain Package?">
        <p>
          At Hostinger, all hosting plans - except Single - come with a free
          domain when ordering for one year or a longer period.
        </p>

          hosting and domain under one web host makes it easier to manage your
          website and troubleshoot issues.

      </FAQ_Component>
      <FAQ_Component title="What Are the Different Between Website Hosting and Domain">
        <p>
          Web hosting is a service that stores websites and makes them
          accessible on the internet. On the other hand, a domain name is
          essentially a websites address, such as hostinger.com. Both are
          crucial elements for building a fully functional website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a hosting plan, you need to transform your computer into a
          website server, which requires deep technical understanding and hefty
          maintenance costs. Without domains, users have to use an IP address to
          visit your website, which is harder to remember and simply
          unpractical.
